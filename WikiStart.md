# Introduction #

The RIFT Authenticator for Windows is (on a functional level) a complete rewrite of the RIFT Mobile Authenticator for Android 1.0.4.

# Pros and Cons #

## Pro ##

  * Increases security
    * Knowing your user name and password alone isn't enough any more. The hack of your account is much more difficult.
  * Supports multiple accounts
  * Source code available
  * You're finally able to get "The Ironclad" title even when you don't have an iOS or Android device
  * The console application runs on Linux too
  * Available as a portable application for use on a USB stick
  * Windows Phone application

## Contra ##

  * When your Windows system is corrupted/tainted, there is a chance that your authenticator will be corrupted/tainted too

# Future plans #

  * Improve documentation
  * Improve the user interface for the Windows Phone application
